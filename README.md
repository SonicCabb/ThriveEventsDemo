# ThriveEventsDemo
 
This is most of the font end work for a new event registration solution for an ouytdoor non-profit.

This is really my first ever go at HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I started work learning how to connect it to a back end, but eneded up busy with other projects for them, so it's just front end for now.
